## Background

The vulnerability assessment targeted vulnerable windows 10VM, featuring outdated software and disable security controls. The motivation behind this project was to understand how to utilize this tool as vulnerability assess,emt plays a critical role in maintaining 
the security of IT systems and networks.
## Methodology

The vulnerability assessment followed [Provide details about the methodology adopted for the assessment]. 
# OpenVAS Vulnerability Assessment Methodology

1. **Defined Scope:**
   - Clearly defined the scope of the assessment. Identified the target systems, networks, and applications. Documented any exclusions or limitations.

2. **Prepared the Environment:**
   - Ensured the environment was ready for scanning. Verified that security controls didn't interfere with the assessment.

3. **Updated OpenVAS Feed:**
   - Ensured OpenVAS had the latest vulnerability signatures and plugins. Updated the OpenVAS feed.

4. **Configured OpenVAS:**
   - Configured OpenVAS based on the defined scope. Set scan preferences, target hosts, and specific parameters.

4. **Performed Initial Scan:**
   - Conducted an initial scan to identify live hosts and gathered information about services and open ports.

5. **Conducted Full Vulnerability Scan:**
   - Performed a comprehensive vulnerability scan covering network services, web applications, and databases.

6. **Analyzed Results:**
   - Prioritized vulnerabilities based on severity. Focused on high and critical vulnerabilities first.

7. **Validated Findings:**
   - Manually verified critical vulnerabilities to ensure they were genuine and not false positives.

8. **Generated Reports:**
    - Generated comprehensive reports with details about the assessment, identified vulnerabilities, and remediation steps.
      
9. ** Remediation**
    - Followed suggested recommendations for remediating outdated software
      
10. **Performed Rescan and Verification:**
    - After remediation, performed follow-up scans to verify that identified vulnerabilities had been mitigated.

11. **Documented the Process:**
    - Documented the entire process, including methodology, configurations, findings, and remediation actions.

12. **Gathered Feedback and Made Improvements:**
    - Gathered feedback from stakeholders to improve the vulnerability assessment process for future iterations.

## Tools Used

The following tools were used for the vulnerability assessment:

**OpenVAS:** OpenVAS was selected due to several factors such:
  -  Ease of Use: OpenVAS provides a user-friendly web interface that simplifies the process of configuring and running vulnerability scans
  -  Report Generation: Upon completing scans, OpenVAS generated detailed and customizable reports that provide insight into risk levels, vulnerabilities and remediation steps.
  -  Open Source:Freely available to users
